3. No Friday games on TI unless absolutely necessary.

7. PLAYOFFS
Majors playoffs beginning on May 9.
Pool play seems likely for all to keep kids playing longer.
AA, AAA and Majors finals all at Tepper on the weekend of May 30-31.

8.  Minors softball â€“
one game per week at Ft. Scott South on Sunday afternoon.  No other games.

9. Mid-week TI games for Majors should max out at 5 per team.

10.Mid-week TI games for Minors AAA should max out at 3 per team.


Nice to haves

3.            We knew that games beginning at 6:30 at Ft. Scott could realistically only be Majors (and maybeâ€¦. Just maybeâ€¦. 
Minors which was then a combination of AAA and AA).  Ft. Scott South is not great for Majors given the funky mound there, so that could leave an empty field space on Friday evening.

4.            We knew really only Majors and more rarely AAA would use TI on a weekday and even then we wanted to spread those out evenly.  We wanted to max Majors out at 5 to 6 mid-week game on TI (knowing that some would rain out) and Minors (i.e. AAA/AA) at 2 to 3 mid-week games out there.


1.  15U Softball schedule is unknown right now.  
Will likely need space on some weekends at Ketcham or Ft. Scott South.  
Should likely reserve some space there for 15U Softball that might be filled in later by others

2.  All Rookie, AA and AAA teams should have the opportunity 
to play one weekend game at Tepper, preferably not the first 
or last game (there are extra parent duties for those games).

3.  For teams playing multiple games on TI, there should 
be a relatively even mix between Tepper and Ketcham.

4.  Depending on our turf allocation from Rec & Park,
we should spread those games out as evenly as possible, 
particularly in the early season when rain is more likely.

5.  We should try to achieve balance between teams such 
that if teams play multiple times against each other 
there is some time between such meetings.
